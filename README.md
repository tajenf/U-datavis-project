# U-datavis-project

Summary
This website will be a tool to explore suicide rates and possible factors that could contribute to suicide. Unfortunately the data we found lacks some countries but should still be useful.

the top section allows to filtering and highlighting of data throughout the page.

the map shows a rough comparison of suicides between the countries with the ability to select countries to look at with the graph and details section.

The details show specific information on the selected country.

Finally the graph will show suicides over time as well as other information that can change from year to year to explore a correlation between the data and suicides over time. Things like a drop in gdp for a country causing a rise in suicides.

Non Obvious Features
it might not be expressly clear that selecting male female and age groups only affect the world map and
the suicide graph.  We tried to show this in our video if not expressly state it.

Removed Features
Coded Feature  - drop reason
World country  - too much missing data so population and suicides got wanky
Year Spans     - again missing data. Also debate on how truthful some data would unless we were doing averages everywhere.
